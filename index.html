    <h1>The Best Movies According to Ace Espiritu</h1>

    <h2>My top 10 movies of all time</h2>

    <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>And away… we… go! After constructing a whole new Gotham in Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan introduced the clown intent on tearing the whole thing down. Despite being a Batman movie (albeit the first ever not to have &#39;Batman&#39; in the title), The Dark Knight is absolutely The Joker&#39;s show – the late, great Heath Ledger putting in a visceral, transformative, truly terrifying performance as the Clown Prince Of… not exactly Crime, but pure, unadulterated Chaos. Less than a decade after 9/11, the film re-conceived Batman&#39;s greatest foe as an unpredictable terrorist intent on turning the people of Gotham against each other. The Dark Knight is full-strength, no-holds-barred, firing-on-all cylinders Nolan – not just an all-time-great comic book movie, but an all-time-great movie period.</p>

    <h3>The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring</h3>
    <p>A wizard is never late. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he... well, you know the rest. Peter Jackson&#39;s game-changing fantasy epic was an astonishing achievement, akin to clambering up Mount-Doom itself – and while the entire trilogy stands far taller than its Hobbit protagonists, this first chapter is perhaps the most breathtaking of the three. The Fellowship Of The Ring contains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you&#39;ve experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a regular film could possibly muster up. Come the conclusion, you&#39;re left feeling euphoric, bereft and hopeful, all at the same time.</p>

    <h3>Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope</h3>
    <p>Such is its cultural ubiquity today that it&#39;s hard now to even imagine the seismic impact of the original Star Wars — of that opening moment in which the Star Destroyer looms over the camera for a seeming infinity; of that first glimpse of a binary sunset; of that first, well, everything. Bursting with iconic aliens, hyper-space travel, and galactic overlords, George Lucas transplanted the classic hero&#39;s journey narrative into a boundlessly imaginative universe of laser-swords and mystical religions, space-princesses and loveable rogues. From its incredible model work, to its cosmic dogfights, to the opening crawl credits that drift off into the stars – the world at large has been feeling the Force ever since.</p>

    <h3>Goodfellas</h3>
    <p>No film hits like Goodfellas. Just like the cocaine that turns effortlessly charismatic gangster fanboy Henry Hill into a reckless maniac, the film enters your system with a jolt, giving you an immediate rush, and keeps you wanting more, more, more, MORE, until it finally comes crashing down. And you have to live the rest of your life like a schnook, because, frankly, few films compare to Goodfellas. The only solution: another big snort of Goodfellas. Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi and editor Thelma Schoonmaker constructed almost the entire film like a trailer, one scene bleeding into the next, not giving you the opportunity to stop watching, to let go, to take a breath. It’s an unstoppable feat of propulsion. Now that’s cinema.</p>

    <h3> Inception </h3>
    <p>Talk about a true original. Christopher Nolan’s dreamy blockbuster takes layers of subconsciousness and turns them into action playgrounds, as a group of benevolent criminals set about planting the seed of an idea in the mind of a business magnate. Along with Tenet, this is the closest Nolan has come to making a Bond movie – just check out that snowy setpiece. While there’s plenty of braininess here (and a tantalising make-your-own-mind-up ending), there’s real brawn too: the climactic action sequence is so huge it takes up almost half the movie, and is actually three big action sequences temporally nested inside each other around a surreal, metaphysical-conflict core. Couldn’t be simpler, really.</p>

    <h3>Aliens</h3>
    <p>It’s official: you rated Aliens higher than Alien. James Cameron’s self-penned follow-up to Ridley Scott’s original is one of the great sequel pivots, abandoning the ‘haunted house in space’ atmosphere for all-out war – a gun-toting epic in which Ripley and the inhabitants of Hadley’s Hope battle a whole gaggle of Xenomorphs, spawned from an egg-popping Queen. The result is one of the greatest ever action movies, upping the scale while losing none of the character drama – particularly as Ripley takes kid Newt under her wing. Packed with memorable quotes (“Get away from her, you bitch!”), underpinned with a Vietnam metaphor, and still scary as hell, it was the first evidence that Cameron would be the master of mind-blowing sequels.</p>

    <h3>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back </h3>
    <p>If Star Wars gave us a whole new cinematic galaxy, Empire made that galaxy feel so much larger, deeper, and richer. Bolstered by the original&#39;s success, George Lucas shot for the moon a second time around, teaming up with director Irvin Kershner to tell the story of Luke training under Master Yoda, Han and Leia heading to Cloud City, and Darth Vader dropping the daddy of all twists. Episode V ramped up the scope with more astonishing model work, dizzying dogfights, the snowy Hoth battle, and a ferocious lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader. It is, simply, bigger and better than the original Star Wars, influential in its own right with its downer-ending and game-changing familial revelations. We love it. You know.</p>

    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>It’s hard to fathom that Shawshank was largely ignored on release. And yet, it’s blindingly obvious why it became a word-of-mouth all-timer when released on VHS – it’s a soulful, smart adaptation of Stephen King on non-horror form. Frank Darabont doesn’t shy away from the harshness of prison life, as Tim Robbins’ Andy Dufresne is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and incarcerated in Shawshank. Per its title, he eventually gets his redemption – but in the meantime, entire lives are lived, friendships forged, attitudes changed, leaving a constant trickle of hope amid the vast darkness. The sheer emotional release of it all has made it a perennial favourite, deftly constructed by Darabont’s masterful hands.</p>

    <h3>The Godfather</h3>
    <p>Stanley Kubrick once described Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s adaptation of Mario Puzo&#39;s novel as the best film ever made – though having previously topped this list, this time it falls to bronze position. At once an arthouse drama and a commercial blockbuster, The Godfather marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. An icon of the gangster genre, it’s imprinted in popular culture – &quot;Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes&quot;, the horse&#39;s head in the bed – but the first instalment of Brando&#39;s cotton-cheeked patriarch&#39;s fight for power is so much more than those moments. With performances, style and substance to savour, it managed to both smash box office records and live on as a staple of cinematic canon.</p>

    <h3> Jaws</h3>
    <p>The impact of Jaws simply cannot be overstated. It created the notion of the summer blockbuster. It made millions feel it wasn’t safe to go back in the water. And, for all the clear potential of his early work, it well and truly put Spielberg on the map. It was, famously, nightmarish to shoot — waterlogged, behind schedule, over budget, and with a mechanical shark that kept breaking. But for all that churn beneath the surface, what the audience sees is effortless brilliance — a tense, beautifully-shot shark-attack thriller with deeply-layered characters, outstanding dialogue, and heart-stopping moments forever burned in the cultural landscape. The performances are all outstanding, but the real star here is Spielberg himself, delivering a pure display of movie mastery from first minute to last — the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.</p>
